\section{Simulation Description}
\label{description}
The simulations are implemented in Java, because of its performance and familiarity. The simulation is implemented using a single-character array representing the opinions of agents. The opinion is either "A", "B" or, in the case of Undecided State Dynamics, it is "U", which means undecided On each timestep, a random character is chosen from the array. Depending on the type of simulation run, we choose up to 3 other unique characters from the array, and change the value of the first chosen character, based on the model being run. Most of the simulations ran had a distribution of initial opinions of 50/50. Each simulation is run with a number of agents of 1, 10 and 100 million. We have not run the simulation with a billion agents, since the running time is too high.
