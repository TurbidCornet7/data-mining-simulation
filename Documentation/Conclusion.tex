\label{Conclusion}
Implementing a simulation was tricky at first, we had some problems with memory optimization but got them fixed straight away. The running time of the simulations can definitely be improved with a bit of time to work on them, but all in all, we are happy with the results. Getting to learn new visualization tools was a really rewarding experience. From the results, we can see that, as expected, the running time of the simulation is directly proportional to the number of agents. We can also see that, as expected, the more skewed the distribution is towards one opinion, the faster that opinion reaches consensus. The end results show that the Undecided State Dynamic model is the most efficient model in terms of time taken to reach consensus.
